### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## I am a QA engineer. 

## I like to be involved in creating quality products that improve the world around us. The testing process reminds me of what a coach does when training an athlete. The more attention you pay to this process, the better the end result will be.

***Currently, I am a Team Lead of a team of testers in a volunteer project (education for youth). I do everything for comfortable and productive work. I know the theory of testing well and know how to use professional tools for testing applications depending on the context. I know how to work with test documentation (Test plan, User stories, Checklist, Test case, Bug report) and have a good command of bug tracking systems (TestRail, Jira, Trello). I understand QA processes and STLC/SDLC stages and clearly know the role of a QA engineer at different stages. I understand the intricacies of API testing. I have experience with SQL databases. In my free time, I improve my English and practice test automation (Cypress).***

***My first degree is in marketing, and I have a good understanding of end-user needs, which helps me to be more objective about suggestions for improving the development and testing of the final product.***

***I will be glad to cooperate in the field of QA.***

***Thank you for your attention and I wish you success!***
